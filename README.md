# Enron-Email-Spam-Classification
This repository contains a jupyter notebook and a dataset detailing my data analysis on a labelled dataset of enron spam emails.<br/>
The dataset is from: https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/ <br/><br/>
Future Updates:<ul>
  <li>Adding a version using more efficient neural network classifiers such as pytorch, fastai, etc.
  <li>My models utilise approximately 10,000 observations despite more labelled data existing due to local machine restrictions, once the code is finalised and optimised I plan to increase the number of observations.
